# ib_private
The Itty Bitty model public repo. These scripts will not run properly without Earable data. Earable data is not public.  

* Running "python3 student.py" will train, evaluate, and save the student model.  
* Running "python3 eval_only.py" will evaluate the student and provide a confusion matrix.  
* Careful - only use "python3 eval_only.py" so as not to overwrite the model. Different hardware/ software platforms can output different models.  
* If you have access to the private data storage, place "student_test_set.npz" and "student_train_set.npz" into the same directory as the student.py and eval_only scripts. These can be found in the Student directory inside the Team2 directory. The train data is ground truth x data with modified TSN's y outputs. The test data is ground truth x and y data. Tip: It's much faster to load lots of data from one .npz file than several smaller files (which requires array/list concatonation).  
* Student.py and eval_only.py can then be used.
